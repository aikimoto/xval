Dear ICCAT core modelling group folks,


The ABFT MSE package is up and working with the latest operating models.

While respecting the ongoing ICCAT MSE process, there is an opportunity for the CMG et al. to publish a science paper investigating candidate management approaches (or not depending on interest / feedback from the Chairs). 

The package will be made publicly available so either we do this or someone else will! 

Here is a link to a preliminary working manuscript: "Strategies and Tactics in the Campaign for Sustainability of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna" 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1K9kuBvZd-kfqX2hRnXwwdLkw1oHat1hJQpt4Z-EhM/edit?usp=sharing

Currently this draft is more of a proposal that I would like to get feedback on. The idea of the paper is to identify discrete strategies.  E.g: 
  
  A: assessments linked to harvest control rules
  B: simple MPs linked to indices
  C: simple MPs linked to gene tagging  (theoretical I realize)
  D: size limits (theoretical I realize)
  E: time-area closures

and a set of MPs for each strategy that provide tactical advice.

* The first priority is agreeing on a list of viable or interesting strategies and MPs. See google sheet below or table 1 of the google document above

** The secondary priority is for me to write up the methods and do the calculations / summarize the results. All of the text is just a place holder for more informed commentary by you, who know more about these fisheries than I. I've suggested people for paragraphs of the introduction but of course no one is obliged to even work on this paper if they do not wish to. 

Please let me know what you think.


Best regards,

Tom
