Estimation and communication of uncertainty. Estimation of uncertainty can be based on a variety of methods including model validation using empirical observations, model validation using experimental simulations, and model-model comparison. This may include the analysis of past trends. Uncertainty also needs to be communicated in innovative and transparent ways to decision makers. Model validation will require close collaboration with observation systems.


There are a very wide variety of reference points available as benchmarks for different management objectives. For most fisheries, more than one reference point is needed to outline the overall management strategy. FAO (1993) describes most of the commonly applied reference points and that summary will not be repeated here. Exceeding a reference can, in one way or another, be classified as overfishing. However, overfishing can take a number of forms; for example, target overfishing, growth overfishing, recruitment overfishing, and economic overfishing. While the first type of overfishing is associated with a target, growth and recruitment overfishing are generally associated with thresholds or limit reference points (FAO 1993), and economic overfishing may be expressed in terms of either targets or limits, depending on the definition used. The difference is that while fishing activity is expected to fluctuate about targets, limits should generally not be crossed. Strictly, target overfishing could be said to occur whenever the target is overshot; however, small deviations would not generally be considered serious until and unless a consistent bias became apparent. Conversely, even a single violation of a limit reference point may indicate the need for immediate action to reduce fishing mortality.
